Agile Planning Tool - TODO File
===============================

How can we make a planning tool easier. No installations, no logins, no clickety click. What
we have here is a way of managing a project by simply applying Agile techniques to a file.

There will be convensions and processes for all the usual use cases that we need but all
can be achieved from this file.

o Project

Each project will start with a title and description.

    === Project: Some useful name
    A description of what the project is about and may something about who the customer is.

o Backlog

We will collect stories in this file under the Backlog heading. Each story will have a heading
priority and estimate in a standard format so that we can cut/paste them around.

    === Backlog

    1 8 Design Tool
    I want a tool that doesn't take me days to understand. I want something that 
    will stop people telling my I do things the complicated way. This is it. Deal.

    2 8 Add Stories
    A user can scroll to the backlog and type in what they want as long as it is in
    the format that these sample stories are in.

o  Release Planning

We need a long term plan that will help us aim for a goal. Define them as follows

    === Release: Explain TODO to Pauls
    I want to be able to define this process and explain it to Paul. If he likes it
    then we will polish it up and expand the feedback audience.

o  Iteration Planning

Each iteration will be created and tracked in date order so that they can be found
easily. Each will have the stories from the Release Backlog cut/paste into it.

    === Iteration: Define process
    We are adding this documentation to defin the process for the first iteration.
    Now this is not hard. I think I like it.

o  Stories

As we have seen from the examples stories can be added to the Backlog but they 
can also be created in a Release Backlog or Iteration. Just use the standard format

    1 32 Take a Thirty Two hour strole
    Ok, that is a long store, you don't really have to be gone that long.

o  Tasks

You can track tasks within stories if you like. I personally like this to help me
collect more details about how I am going to approach the story and communicate that
to others that might want to look in on what is going on.

    2 5 Something
    Some details about the story.

        4 do the first part of something
        More description if necessary

        2 do the second part of something.
    

o  Sequence

The features described above must exist in a well defined sequence in the project 
file so that they can always be found.

    === Release
    === Iteration (current iteration only)
    === Release Backlog
    === Backlog

o  Maintenance

As releases and iterations are completed they must be deleted from the file. Since
this file exists in source control the information will always be available.

=============================================================================================
=== Project: Sewing Seeds of Literacty
The Sewing Seeds of Literacy (ssol) project aims to organize volumeers, doners and charities
into a single system that will allow them to interact, track progress, understand goals
and generally be able to share and commnicate with each other in a safe, transparent and
productive way.

=== Release: Home Page
We need a simple home page that will present what SSOL is and who to contact for more information.

=== Iteration: December 2008

1 8 Picture Viewer
We have chosen the http://www.e2interactive.com/e2_photo_gallery/ photo viewer for the front
page and have 3ish pictures for visitors to cycle through. Curently they are on the local 
disk but one day they can all come from flickr.

1 2 Improve Logo in header
The logo in the header is very coarse. Nick needs to do somehting about it.

    1 Send Nick an email about the logo problem with a screenshot.

=== Backlog

1 8 Deploy site
We can go ahead and deploy the site to the sewingseedsofliteracy.com domain now, even though
its not finished because no-one goes there anyway. Ha.

3 16 Integrate E2 with Flickr
With a standard gallery name on the flickr server we can just cycle through all the photos
in it. This way the SSOL volunteers can add photos as they like and they will be included
in the web page.
